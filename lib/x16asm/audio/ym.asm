; x16lib :: audio/ym.asm -- YM2151 FM synthesiser
; =====================================================================
; This file EMITS CODE. Source it exactly once (x16_code.asm does).
;
; The chip is at YM_REG ($9F40) and YM_DATA ($9F41). Note: NOT $9FE0.
;
; Two ways in, and they do not mix freely:
;
;   ym_write   writes a chip register directly. Fast, complete access to
;              everything (LFO, per-operator envelopes) -- but the ROM
;              audio driver keeps RAM shadows of volume and pan, and a
;              raw write leaves those stale.
;
;   ym_poke    goes through the ROM driver in BANK_AUDIO, keeping its
;              shadows coherent. Use this if you also use the note API.
;
; This is the AUDIOYM.TXT distinction between YM! and FMPOKE.

; ym_write -- raw register write
;   in:  A = value, X = register
;   out: carry clear on success, set if the chip stayed busy
;   Preserves A and X.
;
; The busy flag must be clear before touching YM_REG, and the chip needs
; settling time between the register select and the data write. Wrapped
; in sei so an interrupt cannot land between the two halves and leave a
; half-issued write behind.

; ROM driver entry points. All of these live in BANK_AUDIO at $C000+,
; not in the $FFxx jump table, so they go through jsrfar.
;
; jsrfar restores the callee's processor status on the way out, so the
; carry flag survives in BOTH directions: you can pass a flag in (as
; ym_patch does) and read a result out.
;
; ***  THE CHANNEL GOES IN ym_A, NOT ym_X.  ***
; Every one of these takes the FM channel (0-7) in ym_A and its payload in
; ym_X. That is the opposite of what the register-level ym_write does, and
; the opposite of what you would guess. Getting it backwards plays a
; valid-looking note on the wrong channel rather than failing.
